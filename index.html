                During my WIL placement, I was extensively engaged in the development and management of a project for a restaurant system, concentrating largely on process automation and user interaction optimization. The project centered on two primary functionalities: drag-and-drop menu management and post automation, which constituted the backbone of the final product. Initially, I investigated low-code platforms such as AppSheet to optimize the development process by constructing a demonstration application. Nonetheless, the constrained capabilities of AppSheet prompted us to shift to more versatile tools, namely React and Node.js.

              <br>
              <p class="timeline-text">
                I first configured MongoDB for data storage but subsequently changed to MySQL for the web application to better correspond with the project's requirements and enhance back-end operations. The choice to transition to MySQL was motivated by its enhanced interoperability with our system and the demands for organized data management. To enhance the system's automation capabilities, I utilized Zapier to automate Facebook posts, resolved API authorization issues, and examined the APIs of Facebook, Instagram, and Imgur for additional connection possibilities. Despite the initial promise of utilizing Imgur for image hosting within Zapier processes, its membership approach led us to dismiss this alternative.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p class="timeline-text">
                Alongside the technical work, I created a comprehensive user manual to assist end-users in properly navigating and utilizing the web platform. Despite my efforts and contributions, I acknowledged other situations where different activities would have yielded better outcomes.

                An aspect for improvement is the initial reliance on AppSheet. The transition from AppSheet, a no-code platform facilitating quick prototyping, to React and Node.js during the project led to inefficiencies. The time spent on AppSheet, although advantageous for understanding low-code solutions, would have been more effectively utilized by designing the project entirely in React from the beginning. This alteration would have provided enhanced flexibility and saved considerable development time.

                Furthermore, concurrently managing back-end development alongside front-end integration presented significant challenges. The learning curve related to these systems, particularly with API integration and automation, caused some delays. While I successfully employed Zapier for automation, I should have undertaken more comprehensive study into free or more versatile picture hosting alternatives earlier. The decision to explore Imgur first, which required a paid membership, led to complications that may have been avoided with a more thorough examination of free hosting options.
                Concerning team collaboration, although I communicated the technical information proficiently, I ought to have employed a more assertive approach in aligning team members with the project's long-term technical objective. This may have improved the overall efficiency of the transition between technologies, decreasing the time needed to adapt to new platforms.

                Upon review, the decision to invest in AppSheet, while advantageous for demo creation, ultimately represented a misjudgment that impeded the core development process. A more judicious approach would have been to favor React and Node.js from the beginning. This would have enabled enhanced flexibility, especially concerning scalability and the integration of customized features. In contrast, my expertise in addressing API-related issues and efficiently automating Facebook posts was a significant achievement. It demonstrated my inventiveness in overcoming technological challenges, particularly with external tools like Zapier. Configuring MongoDB and integrating it with MySQL demonstrated my strong back-end programming skills; nonetheless, balancing these tasks with front-end responsibilities was difficult. My inquiry into Instagram and Facebook APIs, while fruitful, might have been expanded earlier to identify more optimal options for image hosting. Furthermore, creating a user manual was a vital addition that highlighted my commitment to delivering a thorough product, so ensuring user satisfaction.
